was, I was saying that step one, I, I've despite putting the title and first bullet on here, I failed to start recording.\n\n0:12\nSo we've done that.\n\n0:15\nSo Dixie not notes in for, in scope.\n\n0:18\nI, I do think you're jumping the gun slightly wanted to check Brett, you had your hand up.\n\n0:23\nBut do people have questions on the context of a code?\n\n0:26\nYellow, the agenda or Brett?\n\n0:29\nWere you rejoining Dixie's comment?\n\n0:32\nNo, but the first thing was the recording which you got.\n\n0:36\nAnd then I, I had a question on kind of the problem statement which maybe you want to get to in a minute but the delivering value is the thesis that we believe we have the value as far as feature set and everything and that we aren't showing that to customers properly or do we need or do we believe we actually need to build more value?\n\n0:58\nI want to show value in the stuff they're using today.\n\n1:04\nYeah, bra I, I think there's definitely a case for more, create more irreplaceable value if I look at kind of all the top of funnel metrics here.\n\n1:12\nI mean, even if we go and look at one of the other, that I look at, you know, pretty much weekly, you know, weekly active users for inside of the paid population.\n\n1:23\nNow, the heartbeat data we get there is pretty small.\n\n1:25\nRight.\n\n1:25\nYou know, it's like 30,000 people out of, you know, a million or whatever.\n\n1:28\nBut it's, but it's growing, you know, every single month, every single, you know, year, every year, we see it every week growing, it's growing a double digit percentage.\n\n1:36\nSo we we should challenge like we're wrong about that, like big, big, big problem, you know, bad bad news bears.\n\n1:47\nBut all of the data and based on challenges we put to the data team or people so far seem to indicate that this this slide or this view maybe not at 80%.\n\n1:59\nBut it's indicative that everything is sort of growing in terms of our ability to achieve and deliver on this virtue of developer obsession and on the the strategy side, you know, we're nailing the debt value part, right?\n\n2:10\nLike that's that's happening, right?\n\n2:12\nThere's a preference for it right there.\n\n2:15\nThis funnel view is demonstrating people are downloading it.\n\n2:17\nStill people are coming back and using it again and we're increasing through, through improved data, but also otherwise like improved identification.\n\n2:27\nWe are failing on the second half of the strategy statement of showing value to the manager.\n\n2:33\nThat's, that's the starting assertion.\n\n2:36\nIf we're wrong about that.\n\n2:38\nRight, then it's a false premise that we've started this all on.\n\n2:40\nSo, so good to challenge Brett, if we see any other data that indicates other, like, like, yes, there's more irreplaceable value you wanna go do.\n\n2:47\nBut if we do see anything that, that's a big blind spot, we should be calling it out and debating it for sure.\n\n2:52\nYeah.\n\n2:52\nNo, I just want to be understand the scope of this.\n\n2:55\nIt's not so much that we're trying to go build features.\n\n2:57\nIt's that we're trying to make sure that the features are visible and visible to management specifically is like the goal here, right?\n\n3:03\nYeah.\n\n3:04\nYeah.\n\n3:04\nTo give kind of a quote because I started to get some of these Allegro CFO said to us this week, I'm gonna start an Roy analysis.\n\n3:15\nYou're gonna help me survey the users map the use cases and the workloads and we want to build an Roy analysis for Docker for me to renew and love, love that Just, you know, like that, just if it sets the context, not saying it, not saying I want to take your whole meeting agenda web.\n\n3:38\nSo I'm done, I'm stopping, you know, so, so we've confirmed that Dixie is aligned with this context of what the hell we're in the room for, for a code blue.\n\n3:48\nDoes anybody else have questions on what's the code yellow?\n\n3:53\nWhat are we doing et cetera.\n\n3:59\nOk.\n\n3:59\nGoing once, going twice.\n\n4:03\nAnd I, and I realize there's some customer obligations, but effectively starting.\n\n4:08\nNow, we're saying this is a more important thing than anything else in the company across teams crossing existing road maps, et cetera.\n\n4:17\nAnd so checking to see.\n\n4:20\nOops on these next three.\n\n4:27\nAre these the right before we leave the room?\n\n4:29\nThanks for today that we're going to align on those or that we understand what show me the value means right now.\n\n4:40\nNo, that we're, we're aligned before we get to the discussion again.\n\n4:45\nDixie, I appreciate it.\n\n4:46\nDixie Dixie is jumping the gun.\n\n4:48\nI'm sorry.\n\n4:49\nNo, it's all good.\n\n4:50\nIt's all good.\n\n4:52\nBut, but this is, this is the proposed agenda that we need to, you know, for this code to be successfully kicked off.\n\n4:59\nWe need to make sure we're clear on the problem statement and Brett was, Brett was appropriately asking some questions to challenge the scope of that.\n\n5:05\nDixie is sharing some ideas of I think what could be scope or exit criteria things and then, OK, when we hang up here, what are we doing next?\n\n5:13\nIs there anything else we should be covering well, the scripts past studies?\n\n5:23\nOK.\n\n5:28\nI don't know if I got it right.\n\n5:29\nBut this was the first step here.\n\n5:30\nSo problem statement, we, we are failing to show the value specifically to our buyer.\n\n5:36\nWe, we've succeeded in showing value to end user well, maybe not even showing we, we've succeeded in value being derived from the end user developer.\n\n5:49\nSean Sean, you gave some pretty good examples.\n\n5:51\nI think even at her offsite of things like where, you know, we flip over to bird ifs and things are faster but even the individual developer can't, you know, see or realize the apparent difference of before and after but but they're coming because there is something better there.\n\n6:07\nSo they they show up and use darker.\n\n6:09\nThis is this is my first step.\n\n6:10\nI have no idea if this is the right phrasing or framing or not.\n\n6:14\nOne thing that comes to mind for me is whether we are just caring about showing our own value in general kind of in a vacuum, so to speak or if we want to be cognizant of like pod man as a competitor and how our value is above.\n\n6:31\nThere's and that should be part of our problem statement or not show show value to our buyer compared to alternatives like show differentiated value.\n\n6:45\nI'm open to it just looking at given the churn reasons.\n\n6:51\nIt'd be interesting to explore whether that should be part of it or not.\n\n7:07\nIii I get the sentiment there and I like it.\n\n7:10\nI worry.\n\n7:12\ndoes this, does this phrasing Sean make us competitor obsessed?\n\n7:17\nRight?\n\n7:18\nIf we can just show value for what we do in a vacuum, Dixie may be looking to use as a tiebreaker is that compelling enough or do we need to understand things that we don't control and frankly we shouldn't care about, you know, competitors versus obsessing about our customers and our users.\n\n7:34\nI mean, I kind of lean towards obs obsessing about the customers and the users and, you know, differentiation will come from that, in my opinion.\n\n7:47\nLike right now, I think if we distract it too much based on comparatives, I'm not sure where that puts us in terms of, you know, I, I feel like we could over dial on it versus we have a lot of customers.\n\n8:06\nWe're delivering value to today.\n\n8:08\nThey're still buying from us more would probably let's focus on problem number one, our value and then as we get feedback, obviously, we can hone that value.\n\n8:25\nYeah, I'm not married to the idea.\n\n8:27\nJust again, thinking that Oman is the competitor and a lot of the discussions are probably paid versus free offerings that are going on in the sales cycles.\n\n8:38\nThen we have to make sure that that value is not table stakes, but I'm not married to the idea.\n\n8:49\nI see it kind of as a two put.\n\n8:52\nI think they're both valid.\n\n8:53\nI think we struggle at the first one, obviously struggling at the first one does not necessarily mean we struggle the second one.\n\n8:59\nBut if all we do or all we arm sales with as, as a result of this code, yellow like exercise is the ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.\n\n9:09\nThen I think in situations where our customers not considering a competitive, I just don't understand the value we're, we're generating, we would still fail them.\n\n9:17\nSo I think they're both required.\n\n9:19\nI'd actually agree with XC and refer to as the first one because now we're protecting kind of what we have and in theory, expanding or at least allowing to expand, before we kind of understand what we're, what we're losing to our competitors and how we wanna orchestrate that like kind of how we want to present ourselves in those like si situations and then what we would do as an engineering or to blow them out a little peral water or see as it may make sense to me.\n\n9:46\nYeah, and may maybe one thought on that too which, you know, I know we have certain sets of data, but it's not as clear.\n\n9:53\nSometimes I feel like the biggest competitor to us is delaying the expansion of us.\n\n9:59\nSo I sit with the customer and their main, the main thing I could do would be to unlock them using more of us faster, more so than even telling them, hey, you're not gonna use a different open source alternative.\n\n10:14\nIt's like they don't have a compelling reason to or we haven't given them a compelling reason to accelerate their use of us.\n\n10:26\nWell, this will not do that in theory like the net feature work is incremental at best single player scenarios kind of enticing them to log in so we can track them and then enticing or definitely expanding the insight generation portion of what happens after we will log in how they're using us, how the results that we're driving for them.\n\n10:48\nBut we will not as a like there's no proposal in this body of work to add new features that will make the world a richer place.\n\n10:58\nIt's not about adding new features.\n\n11:00\nI think it's about why now.\n\n11:03\nSo to me, it's the value I'm able to tell them why not what value they're getting.\n\n11:09\nThen it's a why now story, sorry, I misunderstood, you know, so hey Dixie is I want, I just wanna confirm something.\n\n11:19\nSo the largest re reason for churn today is because of an accounting error is what I'm hearing from the sales team as far as you sold us this money and we just don't need that anymore and you can't prove and so you can only prove this many people.\n\n11:35\nSo I'm just gonna pay for that until you can show me who's actually using Docker, which goes back to the admin.\n\n11:39\nSo immediately like it's, it's not even value at that point.\n\n11:43\nIt's that.\n\n11:44\nBut then there are also what I'm hearing issues with.\n\n11:47\nI don't see the value in Docker for this.\n\n11:50\nAnd what are those repeat, complete sentence things that we're seeing consistently?\n\n11:57\nI don't see value in the way that you're bringing teams together.\n\n12:00\nLike what are those themes that you're hearing from customers that are saying I'm just out with Docker or I'm considering pod man or whomever do we have that documented somewhere?\n\n12:12\nLike the top 10 reasons why customers turn the, the top 10 reasons.\n\n12:17\nYeah.\n\n12:18\nBut again, it's like I'm going to do it myself, I'm gonna use a competitor.\n\n12:25\nIt's all in that same umbrella, right?\n\n12:29\nBut the, but the, the seat decompression is more than the turn.\n\n12:35\nMeaning turn is a lot smaller than seat contraction and seat contraction.\n\n12:42\nThe primary things are I over bought.\n\n12:46\nYou can't count me.\n\n12:49\nBut again, when I go sit in front of them, unless that seat data is irrefutable, you just can't have the conversation, right?\n\n12:57\nAnd also my point is now they're lots more sophisticated than they were before.\n\n13:04\nSo they don't care that someone is attached to hub.\n\n13:08\nThey wanna know if they're using dock or desktop.\n\n13:10\nAnd the second thing they wanna know is what they're using.\n\n13:13\nAnd the third thing they wanna know is how does, what they're using, add value to my business.\n\n13:18\nAnd I hear those three repeatedly across the customer base so often it, wondering how often is that third one come into play?\n\n13:30\nIs it like every time you hear all of those, I just made a list right now from CE S and 50% of the time it's come into play on my list that I have right now because the kind of feedback that we're getting is not very granular in sales force today.\n\n13:48\nMhm.\n\n13:50\nSo I asked c to go give me a very detailed feedback of the last two months of conversations from every single customer which I can share with you.\n\n13:59\nAnd it's more moving in the direction of they want some value drive from us.\n\n14:06\nSo things like the dock or one on one sessions usually valuable to them because we're educating the users to use.\n\n14:14\nBut the customers come to me like Roche, I don't know what the users are using.\n\n14:18\nCan you help me survey them Allegro?\n\n14:20\nCan you help me survey them?\n\n14:21\nCan we understand what they use?\n\n14:24\nThat's very open question.\n\n14:26\nSo what do they use?\n\n14:29\nThen they're sophisticated people as soon as they give them what they use, they're gonna be like what's great?\n\n14:37\nThey did compose up a bazillion times.\n\n14:39\nWhat, what value did they get from that?\n\n14:40\nJust, just real quickly, Bruno, the, these are the, the categories that Tyler shared, you know, Vanessa or offsite and then, you know, between him and some others kind of the brainstorm.\n\n14:51\nWe did that.\n\n14:51\nThis is just in the appendix.\n\n14:53\nThe one that stands out that Dixie just described though is, is we basically sent our CS team and our sales team to go do battle with the only number available, this thing called provision seats.\n\n15:03\nThat means frankly nothing to the buyer relative to the number of users or the value being realized or the usage, you know, that's occurring.\n\n15:13\nSo that's the disconnect.\n\n15:14\nAnd then, and then just for the human in the loop, you know, categorization, if there was a churn or downgrade, you know, what was the reason these are CS or sales reps as a human categorizing the seat downgrades.\n\n15:26\nSo, you know, two different places to go look just for context as we think about framing up the problem.\n\n15:31\nBruno, you were traveling in.\n\n15:34\nNo, I was, I was just gonna say and, and please take it with a grain of salt because I've been here for three weeks now, I think.\n\n15:41\nbut I I think my showing who's using whatever seat, for example, this this can be done in in so many different ways from, from a product and engineering perspective, right?\n\n15:52\nBut I think my, what kind of comes up to me as a main point based on, on what Dixie said is from a buyer perspective.\n\n16:00\nThey they don't care if you're running Docker compose up like like if we said as well 1000 times, they they don't care.\n\n16:07\nI mean, this can be done with other tools pad man or whatever, right?\n\n16:10\nWhat's the main concern is, what's this problem that my people or my developers cannot do without Docker?\n\n16:17\nRight?\n\n16:18\nBecause if they can do exactly the same things using another solution that it's free, they're gonna do because think about it from their, their shoes.\n\n16:26\nRight.\n\n16:27\nThey are signing 100 200 a million dollar purchase order.\n\n16:31\nI don't know, they don't really care about.\n\n16:34\nDo, do compos doer desktop.\n\n16:37\nThey just want to make sure the problem they are paying for something no other vendor can fix.\n\n16:43\nRight.\n\n16:43\nBut if other vendors can fix, they, they are willing to move all their people to a different solution.\n\n16:50\nThat's a huge disruption.\n\n16:52\nSo if they're doing that is because they're not seeing something that we do that it's that they are paying for that specifically thing that other vendors can do.\n\n16:59\nSo I think that's, that's the main point.\n\n17:01\nLike how do we bridge that gap that yeah, your developers love or loves Docker.\n\n17:05\nBut what are we doing that you really need to pay for Docker rather that if you go to or whatever other solution you build yourself, you're not gonna have that.\n\n17:14\nAnd I think at at least for me, for me coming fresh, that's, that's the disconnect there and, and the biggest challenge.\n\n17:21\nWell, II, I wanna comment for a minute on that because we, we've been doing some user research with mckenzie as a partner and one of the biggest commentaries from customers is that we are, even if there are alternatives that do the same things we do.\n\n17:39\nThere's a certain recognition of us as a company and a comfort that people have with using us as a company.\n\n17:47\nSo there's a very strong affinity to Docker, even notwithstanding similar things with, with free alternatives.\n\n17:57\nBut the biggest input still that those customers have been giving us is we need to be able to see better insights that show that the organization is using us.\n\n18:08\nBecause again, we hear sometimes it's not as a distinct feedback as I would like.\n\n18:15\nBut I think it's not distinct to because we haven't captured it as so.\n\n18:19\nBut we'll hear, hey, we use pod men for the simple things and we use Docker when we have multi environments, we use Docker.\n\n18:29\nSo this goes a little bit to the point you're making there are certain more complex use cases where Docker is favored and we tend to use both a developer might share his desktop with multiple options and he was his option A for thing A and option B for thing B.\n\n18:48\nSo to the point you're making, it may be more nuanced.\n\n18:51\nLike I think we have some brand affinity, but there's clearly, once I get past a certain threshold of complexity, I want to darker and that might be the nuance that would he would help us.\n\n19:03\nLike the most common thing I hear about that is multi environments or certain use cases of compose, but I don't have any more distinct feedback to offer, but that's definitely a strong feedback that we've heard when we try and push for nuance.\n\n19:24\nYeah, I I think understanding those specifically use case like complex multi environment or multi user that would help us to justify and come up with a way that we're saying, hey, these are your environments or this is how users are using that you can't go anywhere because if you go, these are the drawbacks that you're gonna have because those other solutions they can't have because while I do understand brand, brand is important, I mean, everyone is trying to cut costs ultimately, right?\n\n19:50\nSo brand will only help you as, as just so much given the economic environment.\n\n19:56\nPlus we're, we're a very kind of do it yourself type of environment these days, people like building stuff and doing their own things and and that's a problem I I face on my last startup as well because if, if you want a solution, people are just gonna find a github that is open and they're gonna clone and do it.\n\n20:12\nSo I think goes back to finding more of what can we do or what are they doing with Docker that they couldn't do with other solutions?\n\n20:21\n100%.\n\n20:21\nSo the the do it yourself, you know bar that's the hugest in why churn Dixie?\n\n20:29\nIs it the majority of those people?\n\n20:32\nIs it, you know what we can do it ourselves?\n\n20:33\nPlus we want additional functionality or use cases supported that do can't do or is it just like a snub, you know what we can build it ourselves because it was free yesterday and we're gonna continue just to use it as it is.\n\n20:45\nIs there any conversation around?\n\n20:48\nWell, we're gonna do it ourselves because we want to do the base.\n\n20:51\nPlus we're gonna do this.\n\n20:52\nAnd so it's just a better investment of our money.\n\n20:54\nLike, is there are the conversations around use cases just why it would be better to do that?\n\n21:00\nJust, just real quickly, 30,000 of the 30,000, 100 or 200 you know, seats on this is Amazon.\n\n21:07\nSo don't get distracted in the unit with the comment on that a little bit too.\n\n21:16\nAnd it's early in some of the survey work we're doing, but there's a distinct pattern to the diy emerging starting to emerge, but it's not yet, we're not yet fully finished.\n\n21:30\nOne end of the pattern is for tech companies that have sufficient resources and scale that they're just gonna do their thing, whatever that is.\n\n21:43\nAnd the other is for companies who maybe haven't evolved their product.\n\n21:49\nThey're in an earlier maturity point in either their developer team structure or their product where they don't need containerization yet.\n\n22:00\nSo there seems to be a strong link to the containerization piece which again, it doesn't tell you why it's differentiated completely.\n\n22:08\nBut once a a choice needs to be made, you know, instead of do it yourself for the people who aren't just gonna strong arm their way with a large team, they start to make a vendor choice.\n\n22:20\nOnce they make a vendor choice, it's somewhat sticky because they don't like to change it very much.\n\n22:26\nAnd that includes probably some of the developers, but you guys know better than me because you know what switching cost looks like for you as individuals.\n\n22:34\nAnd then there are certain use cases that favor us is it, it feels like that's kind of the paradigm and, and, and that, that may be another question again.\n\n22:46\nSorry, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm catching up on history and everything, but are we also being replaced because people are just building their code locally and then they ship it to a pipeline these days and everything gets deployed somewhere using ecs or using whatever other solution co is that they don't need doer because then that's like the use case itself is, is another thing that we have to figure out, right?\n\n23:09\nAre, are we getting dropped out of the use case or are we being replaced in the use case?\n\n23:14\nSo I think those are two different knobs that we have to figure out as well?\n\n23:18\nYeah, I agree with that also, Bruno, that seems to be a factor, right?\n\n23:22\nIt's just do they have a use case that favors us or not?\n\n23:26\nAnd if they do, do they favor us or not?\n\n23:29\nAnd part of that can also still be use case driven for, for the detail on the churned seats, right?\n\n23:36\nThat are related to this second, we're observing top of funnel metrics looks positive, gross paid seat looks negative.\n\n23:43\nI link to there's some sales force things that maybe everybody doesn't have access to but an export at the top of the appendix or near the top of the the export of all of those reason codes on a proceed by proceed basis.\n\n24:04\nThird link of accounts.\n\n24:06\nYeah, Vanessa, you got it.\n\n24:10\nBut, but Bruno to your point, it doesn't capture the, the nuance of those two.\n\n24:15\nI I do think that's something that we need to address and understanding that I'm curious, you know, as insight as, as important as that is and insightful as that is that nuance there, Bernard, are you advocating that something that should be in scope, you know, for this or you know, related may maybe maybe there's an understand that detail would be one of the exit criteria here too.\n\n24:38\nIt, it again, I I think this, this has to be combined a combination from the group feedback because I'm I'm so new to that.\n\n24:46\nBut my, at least my personal quick feedback on that is if we're getting dropped out of the process because they're replacing a pipeline and that's the kind of the trajectory we're seeing people using.\n\n24:57\nWe have to fix that.\n\n24:58\nNow, otherwise if we just put a band aid on it in three months, six months from now, we're gonna have that same discussion because they're continuing to drop us through the process or if they're just replacing us with whatever solution because they don't see why they are paying us.\n\n25:11\nThey are doing the same thing.\n\n25:13\nWe're gonna have the same conversation in six months from now.\n\n25:16\nRight.\n\n25:16\nSo I, I at least, but again, this is me without too much history coming in fresh.\n\n25:20\nSo I, I, I'll rely on the team to kind of see if this is valid or not for, for this yellow code yellow on the discussion point.\n\n25:29\nDid I, did I capture that if Docker gets dropped because dropped out a pipeline or replaced with a free alternative?\n\n25:35\nYou know, it's a different, by the way, I'm not hands on keyboard because I'm the only person allowed to edit in the stock.\n\n26:03\nI'm just trying to demonstrate by example that I'm, I'm willing to take notes no back to other things, you know, other things we should be looking at or thinking about as we try to codify a problem statement.\n\n26:28\nIs he you've been close to this for a long time?\n\n26:31\nOther thoughts.\n\n26:39\nI don't know.\n\n26:40\nII I think we in the room, we can, we can write down as clear of a focus as we can be.\n\n26:50\nBut I think the team if we declare Coviello and all of that, like how do we actually connect that a little bit closer to what they're doing on the ground?\n\n27:08\nmhm So just going back to alignment on problem statement.\n\n27:14\nI mean, the top level problem here is like renewals in turn, right?\n\n27:19\nBut I think, I think we came into this meeting with the, the, the second level of problem statement which is we believe that people don't see value in the existing feature set of do.\n\n27:31\nLike we, we do, we're explicitly say saying we do not believe that there is a lack of feature set or at least that is not the key problem here.\n\n27:38\nIs that correct?\n\n27:41\nI I think that is a potentially an issue but you know, related but different, right?\n\n27:48\nLike that's, that's just central to the road map, right?\n\n27:51\nWhere are we going?\n\n27:52\nWhat are we doing to add incremental value, et cetera?\n\n27:55\nI don't know if that's the there there's a problem statement we could write that is the business challenge we have, which is, you know, net churn or net retention is below 100% right?\n\n28:10\nNet retention is below 100%.\n\n28:14\nI, I think that becomes so wide ranging and pervasive that it it's illogical to try to bundle, you know, the actions together.\n\n28:24\nAnd so, you know, overly pedantic or oddly nuanced, like what are the things that are discrete that we can go solve that accelerate this issue that we've heard from Tyler and sales from Dixie and others of we're delivering value, we cannot demonstrate that, right.\n\n28:43\nSo, so the, so we we decided to focus on a specific, let's say theme of how to fix that higher level problem, which is showing the value.\n\n28:52\nThat's, that's the, the theme here.\n\n28:57\nDo we have ideas on?\n\n29:02\nI, you know, we don't need to come with like the exact road map here, but like what are, what, what are the people's thoughts on?\n\n29:08\nWhat are we actually, where are we failing to show value?\n\n29:11\nWhat can we do to resolve that?\n\n29:12\nI guess that's the the next step, Sean.\n\n29:14\nDid you have something to add?\n\n29:17\nI was just making sure for the problem statement that we are scoped the right way.\n\n29:21\nSo we talk about showing value, but is it mainly showing value for what the Docker subscription, the core subscription?\n\n29:31\nDo we care about adoption for Scout or other skews coming out?\n\n29:37\nI'm assuming not.\n\n29:38\nSo you might want to scope it down to either like Docker subscription or Docker desktop or something along those lines, right?\n\n29:50\nSo this is just basic business tier, right?\n\n29:53\nLike that's, yeah, Dixie, I, you know, we talked about, you know, for if, if one of the exit criteria becomes something like you know, V later a dashboard that I can like click in as an admin and see all the scene dancing, amazing stuff.\n\n30:07\nI get like cool.\n\n30:09\nThat's big.\n\n30:10\nHow do we deliver value quickly?\n\n30:12\nCould we get to powerpoint PDF that looks like Slack or Zoom?\n\n30:17\nHey, are things like that?\n\n30:19\nDo they need to be for all 40,000, you know, paying accounts.\n\n30:24\nDoes it need to be for the ones where there's a human in the loop called that top 2000?\n\n30:28\nDoes it need to be instant?\n\n30:30\nYou know what?\n\n30:30\nSo I, I would propose based on what I've heard but Sean could call out.\n\n30:36\nThis is for Docker business subscriptions, you know, top X accounts.\n\n30:42\nThis is where we have the problem, you know, today.\n\n30:45\nYeah, I I would agree.\n\n30:46\nI think we should compress it to that, you know, statement, I just put something in there to noodle on for a problem statement, we struggle to articulate and show that Docker is an enterprise ready developer tool that that provides concrete multiplayer value.\n\n31:05\nWe're a great one off tool, but we haven't quite made the leap to show maturation is an idea.\n\n31:10\nSo, and I think that's swirling around what everyone's hinting at because our turn is directly with business.\n\n31:19\nSo how do we focus on that?\n\n31:22\nAnd then also the below.\n\n31:27\nWas it the cheaters?\n\n31:29\nHow we also enforce them?\n\n31:33\nNot cheating, right?\n\n31:36\nI mean, there are no thresholds in the way that we build our product.\n\n31:40\nWe say you get so much capacity yet, it's an open buffet and feeding season for anyone because there's no, there's no threshold to stop them either.\n\n31:51\nSo we're kind of shooting ourselves in our and on our own feet and allowing them to cheat.\n\n31:59\nSo that's a good question, is addressing cheating in, in scope here because that's a kind of a very different question than showing value.\n\n32:07\nRight.\n\n32:11\nWhat do you think, Brett?\n\n32:14\nI don't have, I'm pretty far removed from that side of the house.\n\n32:18\nLike, I don't know how many people are cheating.\n\n32:21\nit seems like a common complaint is that we don't know if people are cheating or we, we feel like they might be but we don't trust our metrics enough to know.\n\n32:30\nI, I put it in this category based on Tyler's feedback.\n\n32:33\nYou scroll to the bottom.\n\n32:34\nThere's, there's ignorantly cheating and willful cheating, right?\n\n32:39\nAnd I think both, both are true and we have examples of companies that are doing this Dixie, I don't know if there's others that you would add.\n\n32:45\nI, I think this, the statement I would probably add or say is that, you know, I think there's the expectation that the will flow.\n\n32:54\nCheating is a problem.\n\n32:55\nI'll just use an anecdote this past two weeks, we, we renewed eyey came to us and said we overbought.\n\n33:03\nWe need to contract by 1200 seeds.\n\n33:06\nSaid awesome.\n\n33:07\nCan't use your MD M system to count.\n\n33:09\nNo, can do doesn't work very well for us.\n\n33:12\nOk.\n\n33:13\nHere's Docker desktop downloads.\n\n33:14\nWell, that doesn't matter to us.\n\n33:16\nNo one activated those.\n\n33:17\nHow do you know that they got activated?\n\n33:19\nHm.\n\n33:21\nWhat else can I use?\n\n33:22\nLet me think if I have this Docker Desktop active user number.\n\n33:25\nOh, here you why you block the heartbeat?\n\n33:29\nSo there's five of you identified.\n\n33:32\nHe says, yeah, I think we should reduce the seats by 1200.\n\n33:37\nI said, ok, what about a survey?\n\n33:40\nI said to him, you know, we had a big customer in the valley.\n\n33:43\nThey reduced their seats and they got a claw back and the procurement guy got slapped.\n\n33:47\nDo you want to be slapped?\n\n33:50\nProcurement guy says no survey.\n\n33:53\nGood idea surveys.\n\n33:55\nThe developers comes back.\n\n33:57\nI still can't be sure that I counted them correctly, but they really like Docker.\n\n34:01\nSo let's just renew flat rinse repeat and in some cases with a less friendly audience and in some cases, I have data where I can count better, mostly still based on IP registry and a lot of other things that are not authenticated.\n\n34:23\nBut that's the that rinse repeat story is just every day during renewal season.\n\n34:29\nI I get that though.\n\n34:31\nBut at the end of the day, like, are we really gonna do anything unique for the ones that's going to cheat?\n\n34:36\nRight.\n\n34:37\nI don't think so and if we actually do something that covers the majority of our population, you should actually also cover the use case for the ones that wanna cheat.\n\n34:45\nAnd then, and then I think the ones that do wanna cheat also brings out the other thing is where I think ultimately they believe that we're replaceable so that they can cheat if we're truly i replaceable for them, then like if they still want to cheat, there's nothing we can do about it.\n\n35:01\nTheir business is probably in trouble.\n\n35:03\nbut the ones that actually really on, on darker then II, I think they would go away.\n\n35:08\nBut right now if you look at the, the customers that are doing it, it's just like you can do nothing about it.\n\n35:13\n, yeah, I think we could maybe expand the problem state to say, not just show value but show usage both for internal and external eyes invalid in that.\n\n35:30\nAs long as we have the data inside and know who's cheating.\n\n35:32\nI think that'd be good to cover it for this code.\n\n35:36\nMy suggestion, you know, it is Izzy's point is some people are gonna cheat and they, that's just who they are and whatnot and we're not going to get them not to cheat.\n\n35:48\nI think the the magic bullet for that scenario or just getting, you know, the number of teachers down is super compelling multiplayer scenarios that require them to log in order to take advantage of whatever those scenarios have to be.\n\n36:00\nThen people log in, we know no more cheating.\n\n36:04\nI don't think that's part of this code yellow.\n\n36:06\nSo kind of going back to the, you know, does cheating matter to help articulate value.\n\n36:12\nI think it's going to happen.\n\n36:15\nThat's far goal is not 100% of identified users, it's 80%.\n\n36:19\nAnd I think we're able to articulate that much value with that much to user users.\n\n36:24\nThen the conversations for dix and sales get a lot easier and hopefully less hoop jumping and less surveying which in theory leads to more renewals and greater things.\n\n36:37\nI'm still thinking that show usage is important to know like internal usage as part of this code.\n\n36:44\nI think usage is a part of it and should absolutely be part of like how we show value.\n\n36:50\nBut the results dripping from the usage, I think are a much more meaningful part of it.\n\n36:54\nLike are we accelerating builds?\n\n36:56\nHow many like containers are they hosting?\n\n36:58\nHow many containers are developers using?\n\n37:00\nHow many api request for those containers servicing, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n37:04\nAnd I think that's a much more compelling story than you have X number of people using it, percent of your world using it to clarify.\n\n37:10\nI was saying internal usage knowing the usage internally.\n\n37:14\nSo our sales people should know customer zero, right.\n\n37:17\nYeah, our sales people should know when somebody is cheating as possible as we fill up the seats, we have ways to know the information.\n\n37:28\nJust just watching the clock.\n\n37:30\nI know we're gonna lose Dixie lots of great discussion.\n\n37:35\nI think some of these are scope modifications, you know, Sean you called out, hey, who are we focused on?\n\n37:42\nYou know, what's the scope of the accounts for for here proposed kind of proposed final meaningfully off the mark something that's missing there.\n\n37:59\nI know Vanessa you had some, some edits that were a little bit different.\n\n38:03\nI think the enterprise, hopefully we capture for the scope of being business.\n\n38:06\nYou know, the 2000 business accounts do.\n\n38:12\nDo we want to propose this as a as a statement?\n\n38:14\nLike a problem doctor needs to show users usage differentiated value to our buyer because we don't today.\n\n38:22\nI mean, so what do we do with this?\n\n38:25\nSo this is our problem statement.\n\n38:27\nSo we need to show the fixes, identify users which we're working on.\n\n38:33\nWe have great progress there that we can quantify usage, that we can report back and then the value that so this is where, you know, Bruno was bringing it up like the differentiated value is the use case.\n\n38:49\nIt's I think there's also low hanging fruit as far as people don't realize that they're using do most of the time.\n\n38:57\nI'm I'm one we talked about this earlier Dixie where they're like, well, they don't know if they're using Docker.\n\n39:04\nHow, how do they not know if they're using Docker?\n\n39:07\nLike is that just visibility of, of where Docker shows up?\n\n39:11\nThey're just, you know, they're just in so many tools they don't know which one's which like, how do we fix that too so that we can be more sticky?\n\n39:18\nFor example, when you know, these are just simple things.\n\n39:21\nI'm in an ID E and besides Docker, just being on the left, like it's like front and center, like just branding.\n\n39:28\nso that people are like, oh it's there, it's repetition.\n\n39:30\nThey see Docker, they see the name.\n\n39:32\nHow do we also fix that for especially the newbies that are coming in that are learning all of these new tools within an organization.\n\n39:42\nI think that's just like low, really low fruit that can help differentiate us from the swirl of tools that our users are within every day and then development environment.\n\n39:56\nYeah, II I totally agree with you.\n\n40:00\nI back to the, you know, parameters around this.\n\n40:03\nIf, if we build a learning portal, if we build multiplayer features, if we build, you know, there's, there's 1000 things we could go do from a road map standpoint that make this enormous and those are all great ideas.\n\n40:18\nI hope those are on road maps, you know, today.\n\n40:24\nYou know, I think if we expand the scope to include many and I would argue any of those, this gets enormous very quickly.\n\n40:33\nAnd I, I, so I agree, but I, I worry about asking everybody to go maximize return on invested engineering time, which should be everybody's remit as a guiding principle today and hopefully doing those things versus what is unique about what we're doing here.\n\n40:51\nWhat's the timeline on this actually?\n\n40:53\nWhere, where is that?\n\n40:54\nIt is it is it is scope.\n\n40:55\nThere is no timeline.\n\n40:56\nThis is that we can define, we can bound by scope, time or resources.\n\n41:03\nThe bounding on this is per scope and it is the number one per you know, what is a code yellow or code blue.\n\n41:10\nThis is the most important thing that will tap anyone is necessary for us to complete this and be more important than what they are working on right now.\n\n41:20\nBut we should endeavor to disrupt the smallest number of people possible.\n\n41:25\nI would say that's a good question from Vanessa though that like last Coello, we didn't really look at time as much.\n\n41:32\nIt would be nice to have like milestones like this date coming renewal season, we want to have this type of impact.\n\n41:41\nI mean, I, I think we all agree that this needs to be pretty Narly scope because we're looking for an outcome in the, in the matter of months, right?\n\n41:47\nLike we don't, I know we don't want to put a timeline on it, but this is like we need to change this now.\n\n41:53\nSo I think we have to be super tight on scope, which I think would exclude something like multiplayer features.\n\n41:59\nYeah, I'd say that we were just discussing whether we should do social login and part of that was how long is it gonna take?\n\n42:05\nSo it'd be nice to give teams guidelines for when do we need to have the impact let me, let me frame it this way.\n\n42:13\nI would, I'm upset.\n\n42:14\nMy wellness days went away just like everybody else.\n\n42:17\nI want them back.\n\n42:18\nRight.\n\n42:18\nSo we would not have the data indicates that our net, you know, seats should be growing at 10% or more.\n\n42:27\nThey're not right.\n\n42:30\nAs quickly as possible.\n\n42:32\nIf you're working on something else that's not addressing this, you're not working on getting our wellness days back.\n\n42:37\nSo, you know, if, if we can't get that done by September like no wellness days, right?\n\n42:43\nSo I there, there is a goal to achieve that we should go obsess about.\n\n42:50\nYep.\n\n42:51\nAnd Izzy just posted it right.\n\n42:53\n1.3 million identified monthly active users, Iau as the part that we control, I think.\n\n43:01\nOK.\n\n43:02\nYeah, it is.\n\n43:03\nSo I guess the question on, I guess exit criteria we're talking about essentially, right?\n\n43:08\nIs it reduce churn or is it increase ID users?\n\n43:14\nI mean, the we we the thesis is that those are similar metrics.\n\n43:17\nWhich one is the actual, what are, what are we targeting here?\n\n43:24\nBoth explicitly the ID users with the hypothesis that ID and the users articulating value reduces.\n\n43:35\nWhere does turn come from, where do cheaters come from willful or ignorant?\n\n43:40\nThey come from us being unable to articulate to a procurement person to go around and articulate to the business?\n\n43:47\nWhy we should pay $100,000 versus nothing for this thing?\n\n43:50\nCalled Docker.\n\n43:54\nWe should be more explicit than, than kind of what Brian just said with the yellow.\n\n43:59\nWell, so the exit criteria, I think Izzy, what you just wrote is we do not exit until we've achieved 1.3 million identified users, which is not bad.\n\n44:09\nIt's 40% 12%.\n\n44:12\nWhat do you want?\n\n44:15\nWe're at over 600,000 today, right?\n\n44:18\nWe're at 20 as of today, 20% as of today.\n\n44:25\n20 identify user.\n\n44:26\nCan you imagine was 1.35 our goal for the year or goal for this point in the year that was highlighted by SG today.\n\n44:38\nWell, to, to get back wellness days and things like that.\n\n44:41\nBut where, where did get that number?\n\n44:42\nWas that end of year?\n\n44:43\nWas that this point in year that that's based on our, it's not time bound if, if it takes us until 2025 to achieve this wellness days will be suspended until then, you know that plus 200 million, we don't control the 200 million.\n\n44:59\nSo for this one, it's the, where did that goal come from?\n\n45:02\nYou know, we in the last all hands.\n\n45:04\nThe number one Kr for the company of Delight, our developers and admin users was achieved 600,000 identified active users in Q two.\n\n45:15\nThat was the also the number one target for the Bu devs and admin bu we overachieve that on just a raw account basis.\n\n45:23\nAnd we decided that looked too much like a vanity number.\n\n45:27\nAnd so we converted that into a percent of active users monthly, active users of dock or desktop or right around, you know, 2 million 11.82 million.\n\n45:38\nSo, you know, 80% of that equals which, which is our goal is to identify 80% of active users.\n\n45:45\nAnd so that would be 1.35 is where that number came from.\n\n45:48\nIs that helpful?\n\n45:50\nYeah.\n\n45:50\nNo, I'm just making sure we're set realistic exit criteria.\n\n45:53\nThat's all totally.\n\n45:59\nYeah, I, what I do hear is a lot of debate about kind of scope and exit criteria.\n\n46:05\nSo I'm inclined to move past prob problem statement, Sean.\n\n46:09\nIt's, it's Docker buyer.\n\n46:11\nIs there any edit there to resolve that comment?\n\n46:14\nNo, I don't think it's a big enough and issue discussion point to spend more time on.\n\n46:20\nOK.\n\n46:22\nOther edits the problem statement going, once, going twice sold, Brian.\n\n46:29\nBrian's dropping the gavel.\n\n46:33\nany any other before we go to exit criteria?\n\n46:35\nThe the fun part.\n\n46:38\nI was gonna copy paste.\n\n46:40\nYou had, you know, you had a comment here, Sean on scope where we were making clear, it's only for the top 2000.\n\n46:50\nThere's an invoice and a human Dixie.\n\n46:55\nWe had your, we captured your ad early on how do people feel about these, these scope things in conjunction with their problem statement?\n\n47:07\nThe the, the scope of, you know, top 2000 business accounts.\n\n47:11\nIs it interesting compared to having an exit criteria of ID ED users?\n\n47:16\nBecause we presume that changes we make, if we make changes will lead to identifying people across the board.\n\n47:24\nIs, is there any kind of change that would only target these top 2000 accounts?\n\n47:29\nMost of those would be related to this, probably an exit criteria is gonna be able to show some report to users and, and that's gonna be to the admins and that's probably gonna be a PDF, you know, nature thing like the Zumer Slack examples.\n\n47:43\nWe've seen again open for discussion, you know, Brad, we can create a system that does that a click button for 70,000 individual payers or we can do that just for the top 2000.\n\n47:54\nAll right.\n\n47:55\nYeah, so we'll have other exit criteria that will be scoped me, Sean.\n\n48:10\nI think knowing if I'm logged out might constitute an exit criteria as opposed to a scope thing.\n\n48:16\nYou feel OK about that.\n\n48:19\nIt's just when you say frictionless, you show this to someone I wasn't in this meeting, didn't not have any context.\n\n48:26\nThen I might think frictionless just meant like the 50% drop off workflow side of things, which isn't capturing the type of funnel aspect of I mean, people actually are going into that funnel in the first place.\n\n48:52\nSo is the scope, should it just be log in, log out better is the scope and, and make sure that we're increasing number of logins through lower friction and more visibility to being logged in.\n\n49:20\nOk.\n\n49:23\nAny other edits on scope is it really off?\n\n49:32\nSo opens up token authentication scenarios versus login, which I think increases complexity, good, so bad.\n\n49:48\nI mean, it all needs to happen for us to feel good about the work we're doing but increases the the duration of the code yellow and the number of hands that need to be involved.\n\n49:57\nI'm not opposed to it, but I just want to make sure everyone's aware that log in and offer different things right now.\n\n50:03\nRight.\n\n50:04\nSo, you know, one of the reasons from other channels that we've seen or talked about is like, why can't we do social login?\n\n50:10\nOh, that'd be really easy if I could just sign up with github.\n\n50:14\nHey, that doesn't work in the cli.\n\n50:16\nAll right.\n\n50:17\nCan do we want, do we want resolving social login connection systems with CLI to be in scope or not?\n\n50:28\nI don't think, sorry, I don't think we can truly solve for login until we figure out what we're gonna do with us.\n\n50:35\nSo it should be off.\n\n50:39\nMy view is actually if we say log in, it actually covers off.\n\n50:45\nSo ultimately, it's still a customer impact.\n\n50:47\nSo if the login is works and works well and we can minimize whatever scope we need to do on Earth, that's fine.\n\n50:54\nBut II I will go for it to be more user friendly rather than like completely platform focused.\n\n51:00\nSo log in.\n\n51:02\nBut sign I include a sign up on there though because what we're saying with our new installs is it's a half, half portion.\n\n51:09\nSo we have half of them just never really sign up for an account.\n\n51:11\nWe need them to create an account before they can log in.\n\n51:17\nWhich, so which, which is the bigger circle, log in or off, I think, log in.\n\n51:25\nBut I don't know if from the user standpoint to them, it's just login right to us, we actually think of login as an implementation of off.\n\n51:36\nThat's, that's the disconnect here.\n\n51:39\nYou can write either one and well, it's not gonna change the outcome here.\n\n51:43\nBut yeah.\n\n51:46\nSo if we were to, to do this work for log in and then take it to you know, the churning seats, would they care?\n\n51:55\nWould it change anything for them?\n\n51:57\nHm.\n\n51:59\nWhat would that be like?\n\n52:00\nThey would care?\n\n52:01\nWe would capture a lot more.\n\n52:03\nMhm.\n\n52:05\nThey, they couldn't deny that they have had logged in essentially, right.\n\n52:08\nThat's the thesis is that the more people, the more we encourage people to log in.\n\n52:12\nMar showed up this morning and we got a bunch of people to log in just from asking them to genius.\n\n52:17\nYeah.\n\n52:19\nSo yeah, I may maybe that'll help enough.\n\n52:22\nWe'll see Yeah, anything that makes Yeah, exactly.\n\n52:28\nSo we're there for login.\n\n52:29\nBut so what, what additional value does the authentication offer to them?\n\n52:33\nThe user?\n\n52:36\nIt's a great question, Vanessa, I think explicitly it it could be, but I think it's probably out of scope for this step one.\n\n52:42\nThey're getting value today.\n\n52:44\nHow are we demonstrating that value?\n\n52:46\nWe demonstrate the linkage that you, you know the diagram in the appendix, we see active usage, we see users, we see paid accounts.\n\n52:55\nThere's no convergence.\n\n52:56\nIf people log in, there's a convergence of those right, we can prove the seat you're paying for is being actively used by Jack or Jill and they're, they're the ones receiving that value, pay us.\n\n53:08\nSo what I would like to know before answering that, you know, do we want to do this question is like, what is the perceived benefit of like a social login?\n\n53:16\nHow, what percentage of the user base that are, you know, in our top 2000 human interactive with companies are more like more likely to log in when there is social available.\n\n53:27\nIf it's substantial, like maybe 20% gets us easy to 40.\n\n53:31\nThen solving all the technical details around 00 token authentication C I scenarios or whatnot is something we can talk about.\n\n53:39\nBut I want to understand how we get to the results before we start talking about the costs.\n\n53:43\nSome of the early research that we've done is as high as 30% incremental.\n\n53:49\nBut I think that's a little bit too optimistic.\n\n53:52\nI think one of the, one of the things that we're gonna be doing is actually optimizing what we have today because right now our, our current flow sucks.\n\n53:58\nRight.\n\n53:58\nSo we have a really high hi drop off rate once we actually updated that we would get a better read on how does that actually improve overall impact and then add social login?\n\n54:07\nBut the early research is like up to 30% real quickly before we lose Dixie, Dixie, I would like one of the exit criteria to be one a report for customer zero.\n\n54:17\nHow does Docker use Docker that Brian can answer for his team?\n\n54:21\nScott Johnson can answer for his team.\n\n54:23\nI want to know and then two, you know, for the 2000 accounts, something that we can arm your team to go produce.\n\n54:30\nSo we'll need to go to find that and start working on it.\n\n54:32\nBut I want that to be an exit criteria.\n\n54:33\nAre you aligned with that?\n\n54:35\nAbsolutely.\n\n54:36\n100% aligned with that?\n\n54:40\nAnd then Webb, just to mention, I know I'm gonna have to drop off in a minute.\n\n54:45\nWe have some critical meetings staged that it would be good to have those correct players involved in those meetings.\n\n54:55\nSo one of them is with the mckinsey resource that did the mckinsey developer velocity and maturity model and they've offered to meet with us to describe the kinds of data that customers are using in order to Roy developer value.\n\n55:15\nAnd the other is a couple of these customer meetings where they're actually asking us to do the same thing within the context of customer.\n\n55:23\nAnd I think having a consistent team included in that, that would give me the confidence of like we have the right people in the meeting to drive the value towards that goal that you're stating would be, you know, super helpful.\n\n55:39\nOK.\n\n55:44\nDo you, do you just need some people to attend that?\n\n55:47\nI need people but I need them to be like the right people to develop.\n\n55:51\nI, I feel like what we're missing in getting that one pager is a, is the story like we can go build the data.\n\n55:58\nIt's like what we're doing today is we're just assembling, but we need a story first, I think and then we can assemble versus assemble.\n\n56:07\nDoes that make sense?\n\n56:08\nIt, it is, it is.\n\n56:10\nAnd I, you know, do you want to do that with mckenzie in the room or do you want to get a group of people together?\n\n56:14\nLike I was gonna go to Brett Todd, I want to get a group of people together first and then go into the mckinsey meeting already primed and be able to quiz that individual who has this kind of market view and get whatever benefit we can get by being prepared.\n\n56:32\nDoes that make sense?\n\n56:33\nLike we kind of have our view of how we are doing it and they're gonna give us some context too and then we've got the right people to kind of take whatever that context is and get value from it and the customer will be like similar, the customer discussions.\n\n56:54\nOK.\n\n56:58\nAre we losing you Dixie or are you gonna have?\n\n56:59\nI'm sorry guys, I wish I could but I do have to jump.\n\n57:03\nUnderstood.\n\n57:05\nThank.\n\n57:19\nOK.\n\n57:20\nSo we lost, we lost Dixie, but we captured it.\n\n57:22\nHopefully, I think that one generate a report.\n\n57:31\nPDF.\n\n57:32\nMy engineers, they care about specificity.\n\n57:34\nIs this, is this objectively compatible?\n\n57:42\nYep, maybe Google slides or something like that, but we can make a PDF out of that.\n\n57:48\nYeah.\n\n58:01\nIs this a PDF?\n\n58:06\nSo from what I was referring to earlier is actually being able to have a report per customer.\n\n58:12\nAlso don't know if that's to be listed here or write, write it out Sean if you think it is.\n\n58:24\nSo the R related the a very simplistic view of, of what needs to be done here.\n\n58:35\nYou know, Izzy, you gotta correct me on the number.\n\n58:37\nBut if you go to the, the very first link actually in the appendix, this collection of ideas that we've assembled for, you know, user login initiatives, the prioritization of these should, should all 40 of those just be on the list or whatever are, those are the things we should go do.\n\n59:04\nSorry, what was your, what was your last?\n\n59:06\nShould we all go do what the, the exit criteria would be?\n\n59:09\nJust complete this list?\n\n59:12\nPlus a report, not the whole list?\n\n59:20\nOk.\n\n59:20\nSo what's in, what's out based on the, based on the status?\n\n59:26\nSo like we've been qualifying it based on status.\n\n59:29\nSo there are a bunch of things where they're like, not started and on hold.\n\n59:33\nI think everything not started are the ones we know that will help.\n\n59:36\nWe should go do them.\n\n59:38\nThe on hold ones are the ones that we don't know what the frictions will be.\n\n59:40\nWe don't know the impact will be.\n\n59:42\nSo why are we jumping the gun and wasting energy or investment on that?\n\n59:46\nAnd then there's a bunch of like TBD.\n\n59:47\nIt was like, yeah, good idea in theory, but really realistically it's really gonna have an impact on the numbers.\n\n59:52\nProbably not big enough, so not worth our time.\n\n59:54\nSo there's a whole like there, it it's a whole list of everything that we kind of have been thrown together.\n\n1:00:01\nBut I think qualifying them is important.\n\n1:00:04\nAnd so far we qualified, let's see about 20 of them, 20 of them 20 plus there's some of them like for example, log in the hydro bill like we can't really do anything right now until hydro bill is done.\n\n1:00:24\nYeah.\n\n1:00:27\nSo do we, I don't wanna recreate the list.\n\n1:00:29\nHow do we wanna capture?\n\n1:00:32\nI mean a little bit to the next steps.\n\n1:00:33\nOne of the things we need to do is where do we want to track progress against exiting this code yellow, Sean has done that pre for the prior code yellow.\n\n1:00:43\nWe're still wrapping up in notion I think goals, right?\n\n1:00:49\nSo if we end up doing 10 of them and then reach our goal, we can continue but then we can exit co yellow like we're, we're not gonna wait for it for again, Hydro Belt or like we're not gonna wait for it to be ready and then do the permanent logging or anything like that.\n\n1:01:08\nBecause like if if we're actually smart with, with Polish execution, maybe you can reach the goal.\n\n1:01:14\nLike right now, we're looking at 40% of monthly users because monthly users are looking, looking at about 3.3 mil, 1.35 mil is really about 41%.\n\n1:01:26\nIt feels tangible enough for the team, but also aspirational like and leave the team the room of like you guys decide what are the things that are the biggest bet where we can get to that number sooner than later.\n\n1:01:44\nAs far as tracking where to track.\n\n1:01:48\nI did create a template similar to what we use for.\n\n1:01:52\nI've used for the stability code.\n\n1:01:54\nThere's a template where we could use that with the notion that there's no reason to change from it.\n\n1:02:01\nI'm fine with that as a heuristic looking at kind of Izzy's list.\n\n1:02:05\nThere are 10 items that are not either done or on hold.\n\n1:02:08\nTwo of them are related to scout and hydro build, which I think we all would agree should require a login in order to use of the rest.\n\n1:02:16\n12345 have their impact login quantified in broad buckets of less than 20% or 20 to 40%.\n\n1:02:24\nI think the 20 to 40% 1 should be the ones we consider first.\n\n1:02:28\nBut none of them are large impact or level of effort.\n\n1:02:31\nThey're all medium and will want us to be defined, but it's permanent login.\n\n1:02:36\nI would start with those.\n\n1:02:52\nAny objections do transfer, we'll, we'll, we'll reconvene but can we transfer those copy, just paste those that you're talking about into this list here of Brian.\n\n1:03:07\nSo we, we have an artifact of at least where we started transferring right now.\n\n1:04:18\nOh, so we're going back to the web but on second thought on generating a PDF, like, do we want to be that prescriptive or more like having a way to bubble up or something like that?\n\n1:04:32\nRight.\n\n1:04:32\nSo let the team figure out the exact solution and then, you know, example will be generating a PDF.\n\n1:04:37\nBut if they manage to do like a dashboard on on Advent console or something like that, like it, it'd be fine.\n\n1:04:46\nI mean, you can print a dashboard into a PDF.\n\n1:04:50\nSo sure, sure.\n\n1:04:51\nBut of course, what I mean is more like, do we want to be that prescriptive to the exact solution that the team wants to do?\n\n1:05:00\nEdit it?\n\n1:05:01\nI don't, I don't think we have to.\n\n1:05:04\nIf I think dashboard is overachieve on this, I'm trying to shrink rink scope or lower bar.\n\n1:05:14\nSo it's a monthly email to identified.\n\n1:05:18\nNo, this is, this would be if we follow a pattern of how Slack and Zoom use this.\n\n1:05:23\nThis is a sales CS team resource where they can go to an account, click a button, generate a report and then share that, you know, with their, with their target.\n\n1:05:38\nSo there is a version of that report today.\n\n1:05:43\nwould love to see that they're Chinese.\n\n1:05:45\nLet me, let me get that and I'll put it in stock.\n\n1:05:49\nThe data is not good, obviously.\n\n1:05:53\nSo this is a view PDF dashboard, et cetera.\n\n1:05:59\nI was thinking like there's the sales deck I thought that was referring to versus per user metrics that maybe I guess.\n\n1:06:07\nAre you talking about combine that to the the general sales deck too?\n\n1:06:12\nNo, this is not a general sales deck.\n\n1:06:14\nLook at the slack and Zoom links, right?\n\n1:06:17\nThis is a renewal.\n\n1:06:18\nHere's the value you are getting from using Zoom.\n\n1:06:21\nIt does have some other sales material in it about the general value and the slack one that I think would be a high bar for us that maybe we should put in here is, is a, you know, demonstration of your maturity as an organization, right?\n\n1:06:37\nYeah, I remember seeing that deck.\n\n1:06:39\nYou were talking about the offsite.\n\n1:06:42\nok.\n\n1:06:44\nYeah, that I am and I posted, you know, the 14 Docker vis A vis Zoom and vis A vis Slack into our bu channel.\n\n1:06:53\nOk.\n\n1:06:54\nThen the one I was referring to is more like the sales force.\n\n1:06:57\nI probably be able to like query on a dashboard.\n\n1:07:00\nSo don't know if it would, ends up being a dashboard for the first one that could overlap.\n\n1:07:04\nBut for, for these dashboards are great for the what we conflating referred to as the PLG end of the this segment of our, you know, accounts, right?\n\n1:07:19\nSo the self service accounts with a human in the loop, having a human being share this deck and walk somebody through it and describe like what these numbers mean, I think is, is a pretty common pattern and that's, that's just a segmentation specification here.\n\n1:07:38\nAnd that this problem, right is most pervasive with, with our large accounts, right?\n\n1:07:44\nWe're seeing 500 seat downgrades, that's only possible with large accounts, right?\n\n1:07:50\nSo if we solve this for the long tail and we don't solve it for large accounts that we, we won't solve this problem.\n\n1:07:57\nAnd, and then this, I'm not saying it's in scope.\n\n1:08:00\nbut in the future would be something that we would add to that, the business admin pain on who's using what license is being used.\n\n1:08:09\nAll of those dashboards in the future like this work will morph into that downstream.\n\n1:08:15\nI don't see it as PLG because I mean, it's like I'm my team of one but more from like an enterprise standard of administration and use anyway.\n\n1:08:25\nI'll, I'll put a pin in that one and put it in the parking lot.\n\n1:08:29\nThat's fair.\n\n1:08:30\nI'm anxious to see the one that you are aware of.\n\n1:08:33\nVanessa.\n\n1:08:34\nI'm not confident that it tells the story you wanna tell, but I don't know since I don't see it.\n\n1:08:41\nIf it doesn't, then some combination of PM M PM UX and sales are gonna need to come up with requirements for what story we do want to tell and maybe CS is in there as well.\n\n1:08:53\nAnd then that may lead to a separate, a different set of insights that we need to gather from this data after we fix login.\n\n1:09:03\nDoes that makes sense?\n\n1:09:12\nAnd then, so just getting back to like the exit criteria here.\n\n1:09:18\nBrian, the three, I think you pasted it over optimized sign in sign in flow.\n\n1:09:25\nCan we, can we work these in order?\n\n1:09:26\nWhat's what's in a like what constitutes optimized flow?\n\n1:09:32\nGreat question.\n\n1:09:35\nAccording to spreadsheet calm, I it has improved log flow by U I clean up and implement cookies for sessions.\n\n1:09:48\nCould we?\n\n1:09:51\nThat's could, could we add to that?\n\n1:09:57\nBro, what do you, what do you think is a rational drop off rate of people then start with the stimulus for login or sign up to unsuccessfully completing that flow.\n\n1:10:11\nWe're 50% of that.\n\n1:10:15\nYeah.\n\n1:10:16\nWell, I'm sorry, 50% of people fail to log in.\n\n1:10:20\nDo we know why they have the wrong credential to understand?\n\n1:10:25\nHow do you fail to log in?\n\n1:10:27\nOK.\n\n1:10:29\nnot completing it, dropping off.\n\n1:10:32\nOk.\n\n1:10:33\nSo they, they decided at some point during the login process.\n\n1:10:35\nNo, I don't want to log in actually is what you're saying.\n\n1:10:38\nWell, really meta right now we ask people to enter their sign up for their like do ID, we don't do real time checks.\n\n1:10:46\nWe still have the, the, the really old school, I'm not a robot, I boxing and they have to check boxes that comes into this and that like the, the sign in for a while is very, it's meant to be really, really seamless and frictionless.\n\n1:10:59\nIt is not right now.\n\n1:11:02\nAre we sorry?\n\n1:11:02\nAre we talking about account creation or sign in once the account is created or both?\n\n1:11:08\nOk.\n\n1:11:09\nYeah, I mean, I have no idea what the initial sign up process looks like because we, you know, we haven't done that.\n\n1:11:15\nespecially if your org has sso then you're never gonna go through that process theoretically, right?\n\n1:11:23\nWhich is weird like we shouldn't, most of these enterprises, like we're targeting top 2000, they should probably have ssl implemented and so it should be like single button click, go to Octa, come back.\n\n1:11:34\nRight.\n\n1:11:34\nIt's assuming that they're enforced and that they're using their domain email.\n\n1:11:38\nYeah.\n\n1:11:39\nHm.\n\n1:11:40\nInteresting.\n\n1:11:40\nOk.\n\n1:11:41\nWe have 21% of those companies of business subscribers enforcing sso.\n\n1:11:49\nYeah.\n\n1:11:50\nSo, I guess the question is either do we make it easier for people to just create an account or do we push people more towards the existing account or sso they might already have 22 3rd internet standard if you go across, you know what we've seen 10 to 10 for the other business tools, de de tools popular internet things is that log in and sign up on an equal footing or log in is the higher order call to action.\n\n1:12:19\nAnd if you look at our complete set of successful log in, you know, or sign up right, completed off if you will user event, two thirds of those are login.\n\n1:12:30\nAnd so our default flow right now should likely be, login not sign up and I've added some notes here on the next steps.\n\n1:12:40\nI think it should actually our login flow should have like rest of internet user name and password on one screen and not a two step look up process for that.\n\n1:12:51\nAlso, that's the funny thing is actually, I don't know why.\n\n1:12:54\nWell, I think I know why but I've noticed most sites are actually moving away from that and it's because the, the reason why I think, is because they want you to put in your email first because then they're gonna do a look up on whether your SSO or not and then direct you to either go to your sso provider or enter a password.\n\n1:13:10\nBut, but, but you always describe to me a user flow where I put in my password before I put in my email address.\n\n1:13:19\nSo the moment I tab off my email address, we should go.\n\n1:13:23\nOh, by the way, s us up.\n\n1:13:24\nYeah.\n\n1:13:26\nYeah, that, that can be way more responsive, right?\n\n1:13:29\nYeah.\n\n1:13:30\nYeah.\n\n1:13:31\nNo, I grew up.\n\n1:13:32\nOk, like Mro.\n\n1:13:36\nMro doesn't, I mean, I don't know, let's go look at mirror notion some of these new news.\n\n1:13:41\nBut if I look at linkedin, Facebook, Google github, you know, large internet service providers, it doesn't seem to be that way.\n\n1:13:51\n, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, we've got two places where we've got exit criteria.\n\n1:14:04\nForgive me.\n\n1:14:04\nI'm gonna, I'm gonna move all of these up here.\n\n1:14:36\nSo I saw some of this going on the chat but social login in or out, I think we should evaluate it at the least.\n\n1:14:52\nWe need to know if it's worth our time and effort and if it would have a payoff within the timeline that we would want, I wouldn't explicitly set it as an exit criteria because we don't know if it's a necessary or b if it wouldn't move the needle anyways.\n\n1:15:09\nIf I would leave it as an implementation detail, if we find through the doing this stuff that it wouldn't make a huge difference, then yes, we add it as part of trying to hit a top goal of 1.35.\n\n1:15:20\nRight?\n\n1:15:21\nSo there's literally no Docker service that I log into without either sso or right, with a social login, but with my Docker gmail, right?\n\n1:15:33\nAnd, and when available, I actually prefer gmail as opposed to the Octa Sso.\n\n1:15:40\nAnd I really wish github was available because that would solve all kinds of other interesting like permission things between Docker and github.\n\n1:15:52\nSo I, I bred, I'm, I'm on, I'm on board.\n\n1:15:55\nI'm, I'm skeptical of any research that shows identified user would not increase by having social login.\n\n1:16:04\nI get that's a big complicated problem because of our cli you know, interfaces.\n\n1:16:09\nBut describe to me a scenario where that's true.\n\n1:16:14\nYeah.\n\n1:16:15\nNo, I mean, I think the my, my question is is it gonna move the needle a lot?\n\n1:16:18\nAnd I think the the reason being is since we're targeting very large customers, they pretty much like these it departments.\n\n1:16:26\nI mean, even we're starting with destruction, everything needs to be behind sso like we are not, we are will eventually turn off Google login for things and it will be Octa.\n\n1:16:35\nwe are moving away from using github login back to Octa and everywhere that the crappy tools we use that only had github login, for example.\n\n1:16:43\nRight.\n\n1:16:45\nAnd we definitely don't want people using their own social logins on work tools, for example.\n\n1:16:51\nSo I don't know, I mean, I, I don't know how much impact it would make, but I'm open to the idea.\n\n1:16:57\nShould we find that necessary?\n\n1:16:59\nYeah.\n\n1:17:00\nYeah.\n\n1:17:01\nWell, I think the question isn't so much.\n\n1:17:02\nWill this add value?\n\n1:17:03\nI think it will increase the number of people that are logging in.\n\n1:17:06\nBut more will it add value relative to the other things we could be doing with that time?\n\n1:17:12\nGiven that we, we quantify it as a large body of work across multiple B US just by the nature of how the problem needs to be solved.\n\n1:17:18\nFrom an engineering perspective is these data shows that only 21% of customers use SSO which tells us that 79% do not.\n\n1:17:27\nSome of them likely use social logins or corporate social logins up to us to decide if we want to go for it or not.\n\n1:17:36\nI'm inclined to do it because I feel you want us to.\n\n1:17:39\nBut I recognize that I report to you that could be biasing me to clarify that 21%.\n\n1:17:45\nIf that's what if you're referring to about as you stated earlier, that's sso enforcement versus sso usage.\n\n1:17:53\nSo there's kind of two states there's, can you use SSO and then are you required, are you enforced to use SSO?\n\n1:18:01\nSo it's not that only, it's not that 21% of the companies are using it.\n\n1:18:07\nWe have a better metric for those that are using it.\n\n1:18:10\n40 40% have SSO connection established.\n\n1:18:14\n21% is enforcing SSO as a logging mechanism.\n\n1:18:18\n0, 60 versus 79.\n\n1:18:22\nYeah, I, I would just say that it's good to do a cost benefit analysis where it, that should be the exit criteria.\n\n1:18:28\nOne thing that with this last code yellow is that as we went along, we did add additional exit criteria.\n\n1:18:34\nSo based on that cost benefit analysis, we could always say, hey, this is really worth it.\n\n1:18:39\nThese other efforts aren't moving the needle and we could promote that to being exit criteria.\n\n1:18:44\nYeah, I think the exit criteria should remain consistent with the 1.35 monthly identified users or whatnot, how we get there is up to us.\n\n1:18:54\nSo your point is sooner or later, we might, well, we might have to do this in order to achieve the exit criteria, but we could achieve without it and do it as part of other non Coello Non Wellness Day interrupted development activities just the way that we've went about tactically with the previous code yellow is that we do have a list of punch list items that we think are going to move the needle, if we find it's not gonna move the needle, we can always take it out whatever refine it.\n\n1:19:22\nBut just listing 1.35 million by itself isn't really helpful.\n\n1:19:26\nCan't really action that within those meetings.\n\n1:19:29\nSo it can be helpful to have things like this as part of the exit criteria, exploring the possibility that having a hypothesis about what will move the needle from the start.\n\n1:19:45\nThink.\n\n1:19:47\nSo, Sean, what edit would you make?\n\n1:19:48\nBecause I, I think everything below is a hypothesis except except for the report, you know, aspects that we talked about our review.\n\n1:19:59\nI think it's probably fine as it is if we have that proposed clear next steps, milestones with social login, I think that's fine for exit criteria or, or how about how about decision, right?\n\n1:20:12\nLike I'm, I'm, there's lots of scenarios where like Bret's call on the top 2000 I think is, is fair.\n\n1:20:28\nI'm I'm imagining for sort of an ease of use, one of one of the other things that's related.\n\n1:20:33\nBut, but out of scope for this, right, that we've taken on as a bu is the basically speed to value.\n\n1:20:40\nHow long does it take you from Docker dot com to get to first run?\n\n1:20:44\nAnd so, you know, four on the exit criteria right now is I I don't need to or wanna use any off even with hub.\n\n1:20:55\nyou know, right now we've we've taken and applied, you know, repo level security things to other things where they don't necessarily need to be used.\n\n1:21:07\nAnd so the super majority of our revenue today is in these, you know, two hun top 200 top 2000 accounts.\n\n1:21:15\nAnd many of those are Docker desktop only, right hub is verboten.\n\n1:21:19\nSo one of these login flow things that is not explicit here is like the login flow cannot touch hub, right?\n\n1:21:25\nIf a hub dot domain shows up, we're dead.\n\n1:21:32\nAnd and would propose that as we launch additional and other services I can log into Docker and then the off related events that have a higher security bar, four things that, that warrant it, you know, are, are separate in an additional two, just I have a quote unquote, you know, access to whatever is a base level security parameter of Docker stuff, right?\n\n1:21:57\nThat's, that's if any of that's valid, it's not articulated well, in what we've written here so far.\n\n1:22:04\nYeah, I think there's a big opportunity for us to do like privilege, privilege escalation.\n\n1:22:10\nYou see this in a lot of other tools like github where I can do most of the stuff in github until I try to do one of the admin things in github.\n\n1:22:17\nAnd then every time it asks me for my, my two fa right?\n\n1:22:21\nWe don't do any kind of differentiation like that today.\n\n1:22:24\nI don't know whether that should be in scope for this, it might be a big piece of work.\n\n1:22:29\nBut it should definitely be on the road map at some point.\n\n1:22:32\nI feel like, so I was thinking that would you think that would increase the number of identified users though or is there?\n\n1:22:41\nWell, my, my, my thinking here is like, you know, the web's continuous apps to never get logged out of desktop, that might be more OK?\n\n1:22:48\nIf we only let you do a handful of things at that base permission level.\n\n1:22:52\nAnd if you want to, for example, delete or push something to a repo, we make you go up to the next level of escalation, right?\n\n1:23:00\nLike, I don't feel comfortable letting people log in permanently when that login could delete repo, for example, right?\n\n1:23:06\nBut if you can't delete repos without then entering your two fa I'm OK with it.\n\n1:23:11\nAsk, we'll ask cat and Rachel and everyone else.\n\n1:23:14\nBut for me, that would be OK?\n\n1:23:16\nOr, or not, I mean, two factors, even a higher bar, right?\n\n1:23:19\nLike Brett, what you're describing is just re authenticate even, right?\n\n1:23:22\nCould be an escalation, escalate like and escalate.\n\n1:23:26\nI mean, if you haven't logged in or if you haven't authenticated in 30 days, we won't let you do these things, but we will let you remain logged into desktop or try to just just re right.\n\n1:23:35\nI'm logged in, right?\n\n1:23:36\nLike I can still see my name there.\n\n1:23:37\nSo I would love for those things to be in scope for us to go spike and then do because we again, we're, we're trying to solve for usage of the majority of our revenue that does not touch up.\n\n1:23:54\nAnd today that is challenging because of security related things that are delete or pushed to a repo and hub.\n\n1:24:02\nSo if that's not captured here, help us, help us reframe, not just looking at it, but I would propose like go do it.\n\n1:24:15\nMy thought is the, the the low hanging fruit here is the things we've already identified, the login flow, the signup flow, that kind of stuff like we can move quickly on that.\n\n1:24:23\nAnd I think it'll make a big impact.\n\n1:24:25\nI think starting to do privilege escalation, different levels and things is gonna get complicated just like social login and it's gonna, you know, it's gonna end up in a code yellow that drags unless you know what we do with the rest of the stuff doesn't make move the needle and we have to do this anyway.\n\n1:24:40\nIt's like cool.\n\n1:24:42\nBut I would start with things we've already identified.\n\n1:24:45\nThat's my thought supportive of that.\n\n1:24:52\nAlso, Miss dimension when we say we want to optimize the sign up and log in part of that scope already identified with the team is moving rerouting away from hub.\n\n1:25:04\nSo that is happening.\n\n1:25:08\nYeah.\n\n1:25:08\nIs, is he you, you've made this point when we talked on Tuesday.\n\n1:25:11\nRight.\n\n1:25:11\nYou know, there's, there's a lot of things that are in motion.\n\n1:25:15\nLet's not assume that they get complete.\n\n1:25:17\nLet's list them here.\n\n1:25:18\nAnd if those teams need additional resources or help to get done quickly, let's make sure we're offering, asking them what they need and, and offering additional resources.\n\n1:25:29\nAgree.\n\n1:25:38\nSo, 44 and six, these are pretty weak.\n\n1:25:40\nRight.\n\n1:25:41\nWe'll put these at the bottom.\n\n1:25:42\n, what is improved, telemetry over login workflow?\n\n1:25:49\nWhat's subjectively done for that or is that just a different box in the same cheaper and looking that was not on the, that was one that I added a think copied, pasted sea.\n\n1:26:08\nI think whenever we copy and paste, it got dragged over again, there's already one I think up here in this proposed list.\n\n1:26:15\nSo I think this one can be deleted, synchronized login state.\n\n1:26:22\nIs there anything else on three?\n\n1:26:24\nI mean, a A through F theory would each be sub or otherwise exit criteria?\n\n1:26:36\nFour?\n\n1:26:38\nShould we go?\n\n1:26:38\nShould we go a four?\n\n1:26:40\nWell, do we still have the?\n\n1:26:45\nNo.\n\n1:26:46\nSo it looks like it maybe it was dropped.\n\n1:26:54\nSo make sure we have a clear path for all the the dropoffs and such not just improving initial flu.\n\n1:27:07\nSo answering the the why, why didn't complete?\n\n1:27:12\nOK, synchronized login state cleanup.\n\n1:27:22\nIs there a good done, done, done statement on this one?\n\n1:27:25\nBrian Me might need Izzy for this.\n\n1:27:30\nThere is no definition on the identify users login initiative priority list for this other than synchronized login, they clean up.\n\n1:27:40\nI wonder if that's also similar to the social login.\n\n1:27:44\nSo that one is more authentication related where users can log in with cli and we don't have personal asset tokens.\n\n1:27:50\nAnd if they log into hub today, depending on how the user flow works, they may go into desktop and then still not in the loin state.\n\n1:28:00\nAnd we definitely don't have all of that synchronized where, you know, if they have scouts access, they are considers locked in, it's all over the place.\n\n1:28:08\nBut I wonder if that's actually more from authentication angle and, and should the proposal here it more have a decision on the next steps and milestones because this is going to be big.\n\n1:28:21\nWell, it is not yet started in terms of definition and the level of effort is estimated to be medium but has the 20 to 40% impact impact logins.\n\n1:28:30\nSo I feel like we should define it.\n\n1:28:32\nIf it's big, it's big, but we should define it for sure.\n\n1:28:36\nYeah.\n\n1:28:37\nAnd a lot of that is what are we gonna do with the cli users?\n\n1:28:45\nWhat are we gonna do with the cli users?\n\n1:28:48\nAxis tokens Bradshaw feel the same.\n\n1:28:57\nThat was like a solution as any.\n\n1:28:59\nYeah, and better than a lot.\n\n1:29:08\nYeah.\n\n1:29:08\nAnd, and so there's no perfect way to do like those two different types of logins.\n\n1:29:12\nSo Yeah.\n\n1:29:13\nAnd that's what most people end up doing.\n\n1:29:15\nMost services end up doing.\n\n1:29:16\nSo.\n\n1:29:17\nYeah.\n\n1:29:19\nIs it, is that, is that an ex, I mean, if, if we already know the answer, should we write it down that it's implemented or I think there's more to define than just kind of the C I cases, the ci I cases.\n\n1:29:32\nBut I think rounded out definition is probably one there.\n\n1:29:47\nSo what's OK.\n\n1:29:48\nSo define and then execute on definition.\n\n1:29:51\nYeah.\n\n1:29:51\nOK.\n\n1:30:21\nI did wanna ask about two.\n\n1:30:25\nMoved past.\n\n1:30:29\nYeah, I, yeah, I just saw that too.\n\n1:30:30\nLet's finish.\n\n1:30:31\nThree and OK.\n\n1:30:34\nSo are we out of code yellow if, if we just have a plan to execute or do we need to implement access tokens?\n\n1:30:40\nNo, no, this is not going to be sufficient to actually drive usage and accomplished people.\n\n1:30:44\nNumber one, step one is defined and then step two is execute where this is gonna be a living list like the other code yellow.\n\n1:30:56\nOK?\n\n1:30:57\nWell, we might not execute if it seems like the, the perceived veins are in it, they're appropriate or not or the cost of executing it is substantially larger than some of the other things.\n\n1:31:07\nSo I don't want to put it down as there yet because it might not be there.\n\n1:31:15\nOK.\n\n1:31:17\nAny, any debate or discriminate for Brian?\n\n1:31:24\nDo you want to go back to two B for your call out or sorry?\n\n1:31:30\nYeah.\n\n1:31:30\nSo you have generating kind of the view the PDF, this could be captured in the dashboard aspect.\n\n1:31:38\nBut yeah, I was curious if like we have the Docker Insights project.\n\n1:31:43\nSo I was just thinking through how this relates on the ground to our upcoming road map.\n\n1:31:48\nSo maybe to a captures that already mentioning PDF slash dashboard, I don't know in our sales conversations if they're always gonna be using that PDF or not or if we need to worry about.\n\n1:32:05\nYeah, so we're targeting the top 202,000 accounts, then they'll usually have that PDF always.\n\n1:32:11\nSo maybe it wouldn't be required to do it on the doctor hubs side.\n\n1:32:19\nWhat about, what about this modifier on the two A one B?\n\n1:32:24\nOh no, it should be here accessible to anyone in sales or CS, right?\n\n1:32:33\nSo how that happens?\n\n1:32:34\nLike doesn't matter, right?\n\n1:32:37\nSo you're saying, do we need to specify a PDF?\n\n1:32:40\nWell, I guess the thought here is if we only did the PDF, if that's only gonna be shown during renewal cycles, then do we need the user to see it outside of the if they need to, they see a lot of usage.\n\n1:32:58\nIs there gonna be anything that prompts them outside of renewal to expand I for the top 2000?\n\n1:33:07\nIt can be a human touch all the time where the sales person gets the alert on this.\n\n1:33:12\nYou know, the, the things that we could intentionally start to include here as a group.\n\n1:33:17\nYou know, we, we have known for nearly two years from our advice from our technical advisory group that we need observ ability before control observably should proceed control.\n\n1:33:31\nAnd what we have done is the opposite, right.\n\n1:33:33\nWe've implemented things like image access management, registry, access management, you know, et cetera where we give admins the ability to turn things on and off with no view of when I click, turn off access.\n\n1:33:47\nWhere's the screen that says doing this will in the last 30 days eliminate polls.\n\n1:33:55\nAnd for y users, do you want to contact these people?\n\n1:33:57\nLike the observable stuff is missing which, which would be huge.\n\n1:34:02\nSo Sean, I think it's a fair question.\n\n1:34:03\nAre you proposing that maybe observ ability for showing value or showing usage be part of the scope here that we should be talking about?\n\n1:34:11\nYeah, that's what I'm suggesting is making sure that there's kind of like a more on demand information about their usage and value.\n\n1:34:19\nMake sure that we're not just limited to like that PDF that gets generated if that's only gonna be during the renewal cycle, I support the work.\n\n1:34:29\nI don't know if it should be part of the coo or not.\n\n1:34:33\nI don't either.\n\n1:34:34\nIt just depends on if it's gonna drive sales or if the PDF is enough.\n\n1:34:44\nI, I think this is where we have to draw a little bit of line when it comes to scope creep.\n\n1:34:52\nI mean, that just means we'll do it after we finish the other co yellow like requirements versus like basically and yellow.\n\n1:34:58\nIt's, it might be that same in time or things might take a higher priority.\n\n1:35:02\nBut I do believe like this information should be available.\n\n1:35:06\nThere should be no surprises come renewal time.\n\n1:35:17\nI guess another aspect is whether it would prevent churn before renewal time comes.\n\n1:35:23\nHow about that?\n\n1:35:26\nI can't see if we have annual renewals and I can't see good usage all year and I think that developers aren't really using it.\n\n1:35:34\nWell, dinner out both thoughts.\n\n1:35:51\nI'm gonna say I, I wanna see a really narrow focus here.\n\n1:35:54\nLet's just be sea if we cut it.\n\n1:36:00\nHow do you feel?\n\n1:36:02\nAnd I feel fine.\n\n1:36:02\nI'm always in favor of limiting a scope.\n\n1:36:05\nI just wanna make sure you capture the right things.\n\n1:36:07\nSo the other one just rereading three then improved telemetry over login flow.\n\n1:36:13\nWhat's what's objectively done there?\n\n1:36:19\nWe know when customers are not completing the login flow, we know the reasons for it.\n\n1:36:24\nYeah.\n\n1:36:25\nYeah, like, like I asked earlier like, ok, well, 50% of people are somehow failing.\n\n1:36:29\nWhere are they failing?\n\n1:36:30\nI have no.\n\n1:36:30\nHow do you fail a login?\n\n1:36:32\nYeah.\n\n1:36:33\nHalf of our users that want to log in achieve that.\n\n1:36:38\nOh, that's the low hanging fruit right?\n\n1:36:40\nThere are people who are trying and failing like they wanted to maybe imagine, imagine the lift, right?\n\n1:36:47\nLike identify the trigger for drop offs, right?\n\n1:36:51\nOr something like that.\n\n1:36:54\nThere has to be something that's triggering the drop off.\n\n1:36:56\nWe, we just have no idea what it is more in a new flow.\n\n1:36:59\nWe don't even get the opportunity to have the trigger to drop off.\n\n1:37:01\nWe just like log them in because we, we know them.\n\n1:37:04\nThere's that too, but we still need to make sure they're tracking.\n\n1:37:19\nOk?\n\n1:37:20\nWe've got it other edits here or ready to do the equivalent pretty close to carving these in stone and started asking people to jump.\n\n1:37:39\nOk.\n\n1:37:40\nOwners do we want owners to be accountable or responsible?\n\n1:37:45\nI would propose food for thought that anybody listed as an owner doesn't have to be somebody on this call, but anybody listed as an owner, you know, can report back.\n\n1:37:56\nI need additional resources.\n\n1:37:57\nI need help and even if they know who they are, they can let us know and, and tap to go get that.\n\n1:38:03\nSo that would, that would put it more on the responsible versus accountable camp responsible for doing the work.\n\n1:38:12\nWhat do people think in terms of we start putting names against these?\n\n1:38:18\nI'm fine with that.\n\n1:38:20\nI think the name should map to who is being pulled to work on this stuff, right?\n\n1:38:24\nWho is having their normal flow interrupted?\n\n1:38:27\nSo in that case, yeah, it's so the person doing the work blowing responsible Yeah.\n\n1:38:33\nYeah.\n\n1:38:33\nI mean, the high level, I mean, this is why we have like the nested things here.\n\n1:38:36\nWe can assign people high the higher nest or un nested objects of like accountable and then the individual lines responsible maybe so to that end, right.\n\n1:38:48\nTrack track usage is the 1.35 that should be we.\n\n1:38:52\nYeah, I would also argue you could nest three through six underneath number one, right?\n\n1:38:57\nThose all relate back to 1.35 million identified users is that I'm happy to do that.\n\n1:39:04\nIs that that clarifying or unnecessary?\n\n1:39:10\nI mean, like by itself one point, right?\n\n1:39:11\nI guess 1.35 is an outcome but it's done through those other bullet points, right?\n\n1:39:16\nI'm almost, I'm almost like this is this is just a headline, the only tier point, the only thing that's like not necessarily 100% aligned to this is the the so show usage users, right?\n\n1:39:32\nI mean, I think there's two main topics here.\n\n1:39:34\nOne is tracking and then one is showing people that tracking.\n\n1:39:38\nmost of the work we're talking about here is just the track.\n\n1:39:40\nThe show is the is the the end point here.\n\n1:39:44\nI guess the related, I mean, Justin who brought this up, he wasn't able to attend this call is part of the reason it's being recorded, you know, but he and Dixie talked about and Dixie mentioned at the beginning of this call what, what was the example?\n\n1:39:58\nYou know, we, somebody starts using bird iofs, how do we show the value somebody starts using in it?\n\n1:40:09\nAre they successful?\n\n1:40:10\nRight?\n\n1:40:10\nWe generate a file for them?\n\n1:40:11\nDoes it work?\n\n1:40:13\nRight.\n\n1:40:13\nAnd so, you know, we just, we just got done maybe killing some of the observ ability for a dashboard and sales force being in scope here.\n\n1:40:20\nBut are there, are there other things from a telemetry?\n\n1:40:26\nYou know, standpoint, you know, provable observ ability that you are now better off because you're using X that we do need think some of that would come through in the PDF.\n\n1:40:38\nI would hope at a high level but at a lower level, I wish that our projects had a project flow where part of the success of the project, part of the evaluation is ensuring that we have good visibility understanding to the user.\n\n1:40:55\nYeah, so, so let me, let me describe like what this doc could look like.\n\n1:41:00\nhey, people that use Docker in aggregate or divided, you know, make it a per capita basis.\n\n1:41:09\nWhen, when you turn on fast, it's X percent faster, we can go to an account Disney and say, hey, it's this many minutes faster over the average number of times somebody does whatever as a developer in the week.\n\n1:41:26\nTherefore, across your install base of 2000 developers, you know, if you use Docker and have these settings and configurations, you know, we can save you, you know, tons of hours collectively, you know, engineering years, right?\n\n1:41:45\nLike is, do we have, do we have enough observ ability and telemetry between this or Brian?\n\n1:41:50\nBrian and Sean vis a vis the other telemetry work that we've got going with our stability quality coal, we're trying to wrap up, so we'll be able to show things like that.\n\n1:42:01\nWhat I was thinking is that it's more of a process kind of exit criteria thinking, but it's ensuring that each new project that we release, it's both visible value to the developer.\n\n1:42:14\nBut also it, we consider like you know, one a we consider how are we updating that deck over time as we go on as we release new features should be apparent in that sales PDF or whatever ends up being I like that.\n\n1:42:40\nIs that a new exit criteria that we establish a pattern of showing value for new features going forward?\n\n1:42:48\nSo you use the word apparent, I think Brian at our offside.\n\n1:42:52\nYeah, I'm fine with the exit criteria being we augment the feature release process to showcase any value that this feature generates in this report, whatever that happens to be.\n\n1:43:10\nSo it would fall into the bonus section.\n\n1:43:14\nSorry, I the bonus section of to be rather than like another additional, I just put it as a as a six, should it be in the report?\n\n1:43:28\nAnd I wouldn't put it in the bonus section because I, I don't want, I want it to happen versus like bonus things might not happen.\n\n1:43:33\nIt, it should be part of, I think Izzy, what Sean, what Brian's describing is this being part of like, you know, the the road map process that we're trying to get in a rhythm about, right?\n\n1:43:42\nLike has the new releases come out?\n\n1:43:49\nI would like there to be a bonus that it's not just related to the PDF that goes to the admins, but make sure that we're clear about the value to the developer too.\n\n1:43:57\nMake sure the developer is aware back to the pausing resource usage case that users might not even know that we're pausing resource usage.\n\n1:44:11\nShould that be a yellow thing or should that be actually a new mandate to make sure everything we releasing?\n\n1:44:16\nLike that's a requirement.\n\n1:44:19\nI I think it's fair.\n\n1:44:20\nI wanna put Vanessa on that one.\n\n1:44:23\nYeah.\n\n1:44:24\nShe can help us try to define that.\n\n1:44:28\nYou know, for the, for the sub bullets or bullets here, help me out who, who should, you know, Izzy, you've, you've commented a couple of times that a bunch of these are already owned.\n\n1:44:39\nWho do we want to loop in?\n\n1:44:48\nAre you looking at tagging a name for each of the numbers or also including all the way down to the sub bullets?\n\n1:44:53\nI want a name on every single one of these things that the discrete body of work.\n\n1:45:13\nYou think I just gonna do that?\n\n1:45:14\nVersus Dixie depends on which way I wanna go.\n\n1:45:25\nSo maybe this is accountable.\n\n1:45:26\nI just could be responsible for part of the work.\n\n1:45:31\nOk?\n\n1:45:32\nYeah, I would say Dixie is unlikely to do the work.\n\n1:45:36\nShe's definitely gonna be a stakeholder that we in for him.\n\n1:45:39\nOk.\n\n1:45:39\nSo AAA the part of the reason I'm wondering, you know, Bruno got looped in here because object has his hands full trying to get our back stuff delivered to, you know, is there a divide and conquer here?\n\n1:45:52\nIf this isn't that new or Newish depending on the focus, right?\n\n1:46:05\nAre we looking at the focus of I want to see a PDF that where I can ask Scott Johnson, how does he get value out of using Docker?\n\n1:46:14\nAnd he can tell me how, how many people used?\n\n1:46:21\nI sent Brian a list of these prompts.\n\n1:46:23\nHow many developers used Docker yesterday?\n\n1:46:26\nWhat's the most popular poll?\n\n1:46:28\nWhat's the most popular image run?\n\n1:46:30\nHow long do builds take?\n\n1:46:32\nWhat are the most popular builds?\n\n1:46:35\nDixie is not gonna generate that either, right?\n\n1:46:37\nSo I'm Dixie might help me define those set of questions, but that I think that's her.\n\n1:46:44\nHey, I want, I've got a meeting where I wanna talk about the value of a little bit of a maturity model in the next step section.\n\n1:46:53\nThe example, you just share it.\n\n1:46:54\nIt's actually more.\n\n1:46:58\nHow did the collaboration be?\n\n1:47:00\nRight?\n\n1:47:02\nWell, built built maybe.\n\n1:47:04\nBut everything else I don't think is who logged into Docker today at Docker?\n\n1:47:09\nWhat did they do?\n\n1:47:11\nDid they run the commands?\n\n1:47:12\nCompose up?\n\n1:47:14\nRight.\n\n1:47:15\nGet that, you know, did they run the command?\n\n1:47:16\nRun what it run?\n\n1:47:18\nWhat?\n\n1:47:31\nSo I'm just, is, is a gonna go track that down and deliver those things, the vast majority of them based on visibility.\n\n1:47:43\nBut I don't know.\n\n1:47:44\nSorry, Brian, what can I say?\n\n1:47:45\nHe should track it down and then we should talk about resourcing.\n\n1:47:51\nIf he needs additional resources, then we pull in additional resources.\n\n1:47:55\nHe, he's unlikely to be the one delivering, but he will own, he's responsible for the delivery if that makes sense.\n\n1:48:01\nOk.\n\n1:48:06\nAnd then two A through G can we, should we put names on each one of these or is, are these all conflated together?\n\n1:48:16\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\n1:48:26\nFeels like they are very conflicted together.\n\n1:48:30\nAgree.\n\n1:48:34\nYeah.\n\n1:48:36\nYeah.\n\n1:48:36\nI mean, the individual line items will be broken out to a few different teams and people.\n\n1:48:40\nbut we don't know who that will necessarily be at this point.\n\n1:48:43\nI find that being a disease discretion as for being the like central line item leader or owner Brad.\n\n1:48:51\nAre you comfortable with?\n\n1:48:51\nThree?\n\n1:48:55\nYeah, I can certainly move that forward.\n\n1:49:01\nYeah, that's fine.\n\n1:49:19\nM five.\n\n1:49:40\nI would almost, I mean, yeah, I, I'm putting my name on there but I do want to be cognizant of like a lot of these things are like accounts team.\n\n1:49:50\nI don't know if you wanna pull in search necessarily.\n\n1:49:53\nLike there, there's work that my team will do here, obviously.\n\n1:49:56\nbut I wanna make sure that especially for the logging experience that like it goes through them first because like we provide, like, I want to make sure that they don't feel like we're co-opting their, their experience, right?\n\n1:50:10\nSo the, is that fair?\n\n1:50:14\nYeah, a lot of work will be done by Josh and others.\n\n1:50:16\nBut I wanna make sure that, you know, they get the like where they don't feel like we're co-opting it.\n\n1:50:20\nBasically, that's all I was gonna say that.\n\n1:50:24\nGo ahead.\n\n1:50:25\nI would say it sounds like Sean Sean or search to be on that line.\n\n1:50:30\nI was wondering if like we, which of these are PM versus engineering?\n\n1:50:36\nIt's like for access tokens, we need to define kind of the, the product management side as far as what to do with excess tokens.\n\n1:50:51\nMore of a PM thing.\n\n1:50:54\nI think we've got some smart engineers that can play PM or where there's open questions escalate those for discussion too.\n\n1:51:03\nYeah, if you want to take that approach that works.\n\n1:51:11\nYeah, I agree.\n\n1:51:11\nLike number three A axis tokens then really, I mean, like Brett said it be mixed between the two teams, Sean.\n\n1:51:23\nDo you want to take that one or should that be serge or you know who's on first Brett you were about to chime in.\n\n1:51:31\nYeah, I mean, I don't care, we can farm out the work.\n\n1:51:33\nI would say maybe Sean if you want to take three and I'll take five because five is more security focused and I'll pull in.\n\n1:51:43\nTim is our security engineer from the cloud platform to work on that.\n\n1:51:51\nBut yeah, like both of those will be all of our teams.\n\n1:51:53\nSo yeah, just be good to work, I guess with Izzy, make sure that she's in on that too with.\n\n1:52:04\nSo it be easy just to set a setting to always be logged in.\n\n1:52:08\nWe need to think on the product side how users would react if you need like the the company level controls to adjust that or not.\n\n1:52:18\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n1:52:25\nAnd also for a privilege escalation, I I'm still unclear about that one.\n\n1:52:29\nLike a lot of our users aren't hub users.\n\n1:52:31\nSo I don't know if registry access management, for example, covers most users well enough, especially our top 2000.\n\n1:52:42\nYeah, we we can talk about that.\n\n1:52:44\nIt's not important right now.\n\n1:53:04\nYeah.\n\n1:53:08\nHave everything covered not number four, but also a reminder of what was the context when we were discussing before?\n\n1:53:17\nA little bit related to the I mean, it, you know, Brad, I don't know if it's conflated with the base base login, right?\n\n1:53:23\nYou know, if I log in at a base level, then I can navigate to different potentially authentications, you know, for hydro build scout, et cetera, right?\n\n1:53:37\nI mean, this is part of, part of what made it lasting and really successful is that they had a phenomenal, you know, central loin.\n\n1:53:44\nAnd so when I went to go launch product to the end, there was a bunch of things that were just given infrastructure that, that were available to me, like login off whatever, right?\n\n1:53:57\nIdentity.\n\n1:53:59\nSo yeah, I, I don't know if it's unique or different from, from five.\n\n1:54:07\nAre they the same thing or not?\n\n1:54:09\nWhat do you think bred?\n\n1:54:10\nSorry?\n\n1:54:11\nIs which line the same or four?\n\n1:54:13\nFour and five?\n\n1:54:15\nOh.\n\n1:54:16\nThat's a good question.\n\n1:54:20\nOh, I mean, I, I don't know that we should ever, I don't know, what do we mean by split log in?\n\n1:54:26\nBut yeah, there should be one log in with different access controls among the, so then four is four is not.\n\n1:54:38\nYeah, I think that maybe the question here is because they, they are implemented differently for each of those products currently.\n\n1:54:45\nyeah, it goes up to one back end system, but everyone's doing their own implementation, which we should talk about having a core services group at doctor that includes login outside of school.\n\n1:54:56\nIs it?\n\n1:54:59\nYeah, I mean, I mean, I'm happy, I'm happy to push for it.\n\n1:55:00\nI've been asking for this for forever, but that sounds like the position paper we need, right?\n\n1:55:06\nRather than what we have on number four, maybe we, maybe one of the outcomes is that we have a decision made on whether there is a centralized login team or function or internal product at Docker.\n\n1:55:29\nI don't know.\n\n1:55:31\nOK.\n\n1:55:33\nSo following this meeting, we're gonna get this information transferred into the notion template that Sean proposed or something else.\n\n1:55:46\nI support the notion template.\n\n1:55:49\nAny other opinions, Sean?\n\n1:55:53\nI know it's just copy paste.\n\n1:55:54\nWould you mind helping facilitate that?\n\n1:55:57\nSure.\n\n1:55:58\nThank you.\n\n1:56:01\nOnce that's done, I'll send a note out on the Coello channel.\n\n1:56:05\nAmplify that in our bu channel.\n\n1:56:09\nWe'll try to get all that done today.\n\n1:56:12\nWhen does the group get back together where these owners or you know, responsible parties for sub bullets will come back and say, you know, I need help and here's who it is or what it is.\n\n1:56:27\nFood for thought.\n\n1:56:28\nI think this is urgent enough, right?\n\n1:56:29\nRelative to just personally like I want my wellness days back that we should be sinking twice a week on this Monday, Thursday, Tuesday, Friday or something like that.\n\n1:56:45\nThey should, they should be fast like round robin who needs help?\n\n1:56:50\nWhy?\n\n1:56:50\nWhy is this status not changing?\n\n1:56:52\nIt looks like we're delayed.\n\n1:57:00\nOk.\n\n1:57:01\nAnd anything else I'm gonna go find time and first meeting might not be tomorrow, but we'll be ASAP.\n\n1:57:12\nSounds good to me.\n\n1:57:12\nAnything else you've missed?\n\n1:57:16\nIf not, we'll talk about it in the first meeting.\n\n1:57:19\nDifferent.\n\n1:57:21\nAll right, Izzy, more resources coming for things in flight.\n\n1:57:25\nOh goodness, thank you.\n\n1:57:27\nAll."}],"cursorStart":{"line":0,"character":0},"cursorEnd":{"line":3471,"character":4}},{"name":"","isJump":false,"createsUndoPoint":false,"preservesDesiredColumn":false,"keysPressed":["<Esc>"],"actionType":"command","isCompleteAction":true,"runsOnceForEachCountPrefix":false,"modes":[1],"keys":[["<Esc>"],["<C-c>"],["<C-[>"]]}],"actionsRunPressedKeys":["i","<BS>","<Esc>"],"bufferedKeys":[],"allowPotentialRemapOnFirstKey":true,"hasRunOperator":false,"isInsertion":true,"transformer":{"transformations":[]},"count":0,"operatorCount":0,"registerKey":"","registerName":"*"},"registerMode":0}]]]}
